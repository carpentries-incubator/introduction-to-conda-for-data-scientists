## What is a Conda environment

A [Conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html)
is a directory that contains a specific collection of Conda packages that you have installed. For
example, you may be working on a research project that requires NumPy 1.18 and its dependencies,
while another environment associated with an finished project has NumPy 1.12 (perhaps because
version 1.12 was the most current version of NumPy at the time the project finished). If you
change one environment, your other environments are not affected. You can easily activate or
deactivate environments, which is how you switch between them.

> ## Avoid installing packages into your `base` Conda environment
>
> Conda has a default environment called `base` that include a Python installation and some core
> system libraries and dependencies of Conda. It is a "best practice" to avoid installing
> additional packages into your `base` software environment. Additional packages needed for a new
> project should always be installed into a newly created Conda environment.

## Creating environments

To create a new environment for Python development using `conda` you can use the `conda create`
command.

~~~
$ conda create --name python3-env python
~~~
{: .language-bash}

For a list of all commands, take a look at [Conda general commands](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands.html).

It is a good idea to give your environment a meaningful name in order to help yourself remember
the purpose of the environment. While naming things can be difficult, `$PROJECT_NAME-env` is a
good convention to follow. Sometimes also the specific version of a package why you had to create a new environment is a good name

The command above will create a new Conda environment called "python3" and install the most recent
version of Python. If you wish, you can specify a particular version of packages for `conda` to
install when creating the environment.

~~~
$ conda create --name python36-env python=3.6
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Always specify a version number for each package you wish to install
>
> In order to make your results more reproducible and to make it easier for research colleagues to
> recreate your Conda environments on their machines it is a "best practice" to always explicitly
> specify the version number for each package that you install into an environment. If you are not
> sure exactly which version of a package you want to use, then you can use search to see what
> versions are available using the `conda search` command.
>
> ~~~
> $ conda search $PACKAGE_NAME
> ~~~
>
> So, for example, if you wanted to see which versions of
> [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a popular Python library for machine learning,
> were available, you would run the following.
>
> ~~~
> $ conda search scikit-learn
> ~~~
>
> As always you can run `conda search --help` to learn about available options.
{: .callout}

You can create a Conda environment and install multiple packages by listing the packages
that you wish to install.

~~~
$ conda create --name basic-scipy-env ipython=7.13 matplotlib=3.1 numpy=1.18 scipy=1.4
~~~
{: .language-bash}

When `conda` installs a package into an environment it also installs any required dependencies.
For example, even though Python is not listed as a packaged to install into the
`basic-scipy-env` environment above, `conda` will still install Python into the environment
because it is a required dependency of at least one of the listed packages.

## Activating an existing environment

Activating environments is essential to making the software in environments work well (or
sometimes at all!). Activation of an environment does two things.

1. Adds entries to `PATH` for the environment.
2. Runs any activation scripts that the environment may contain.

Step 2 is particularly important as activation scripts are how packages can set arbitrary
environment variables that may be necessary for their operation. Aou activate the
`basic-scipy-env` environment by name using the `activate` command.

~~~
$ conda activate basic-scipy-env
~~~
{: .language-bash}

You can see that an environment has been activated because the shell prompt will now include the
name of the active environment.

~~~
(basic-scipy-env) $
~~~

## Deactivate the current environment

To deactivate the currently active environment use the Conda `deactivate` command as follows.

~~~
(basic-scipy-env) $ conda deactivate
~~~
{: .language-bash}

You can see that an environment has been deactivated because the shell prompt will no longer
include the name of the previously active environment.

~~~
$
~~~

> ## Returning to the `base` environment
>
> To return to the `base` Conda environment, it's better to call `conda activate` with no
> environment specified, rather than to use `deactivate`. If you run `conda deactivate` from your

> you encounter this undesirable state! Just start a new shell.**

## Installing a package into an existing environment

You can install a package into an existing environment using the `conda install` command. This
command accepts a list of package specifications (i.e., `numpy=1.18`) and installs a set of
packages consistent with those specifications *and* compatible with the underlying environment. If
full compatibility cannot be assured, an error is reported and the environment is *not* changed.

By default the `conda install` command will install packages into the current, active environment.
The following would activate the `basic-scipy-env` we created above and install
[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/), an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python
and NumPy code into fast machine code, into the active environment.

~~~
$ conda activate basic-scipy-env
$ conda install numba
~~~
{: .language-bash}

As was the case when listing packages to install when using the `conda create` command, if version
numbers are not explicitly provided, Conda will attempt to install the newest versions of any
requested packages. To accomplish this, Conda may need to update some packages that are already
installed or install additional packages. It is always a good idea to explicitly provide version
numbers when installing packages with the `conda install` command. For example, the following would
install a particular version of Scikit-Learn, into the current, active environment.

~~~
$ conda install scikit-learn=0.22
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Freezing installed packages
>
> To prevent existing packages from being updating when using the `conda install` command, you can
> use the `--freeze-installed` option. This may force Conda to install older versions of the
> requested packages in order to maintain compatibility with previously installed packages. Using
> the `--freeze-installed` option does not prevent additional dependency packages from being
> installed.

## Where do Conda environments live?

Environments created with `conda`, by default, live in the `envs/` folder of your `miniconda3` (or `anaconda3`) directory the absolute path to which will look something the following: `/Users/$USERNAME/miniconda3/envs` or `C:\Users\$USERNAME\Anaconda3`.

Running `ls` (linux) / `dir` (Windows) on your anaconda `envs/` directory will list out the directories containing the existing Conda environments.

{: .callout}


## How do I specify a location for a Conda environment?

You can control where a Conda environment lives by providing a path to a target directory when
creating the environment. For example to following command will create a new environment in a
sub-directory of the current working directory called `env`.

~~~
$ conda create --prefix ./env ipython=7.13 matplotlib=3.1 pandas=1.0 python=3.6
~~~
{: .language-bash}

You activate an environment created with a prefix using the same command used to activate
environments created by name.

~~~
$ conda activate ./env
~~~
{: .language-bash}

It is often a good idea to specify a path to a sub-directory of your project directory when
creating an environment. Why?

1.  Makes it easy to tell if your project utilizes an isolated environment by including the
    environment as a sub-directory.
2.  Makes your project more self-contained as everything *including the required software* is
    contained in a single project directory.

An additional benefit of creating your project's environment inside a sub-directory is that you
can then use the same name for all your environments; if you keep all of your environments in
your `~/miniconda3/env/` folder, you’ll have to give each of them a different name.

> ## Conda environment sub-directory naming convention
>
> In order to be consistent with the convention used by tools such as `venv` and `Pipenv`, I
> recommend using `env` as the name of the sub-directory of your project directory that contains
> your Conda environment. A benefit of maintaining the convention is that your environment
> sub-directory will be automatically ignored by the default Python `.gitignore` file used on

>
> Whatever naming convention you adopt it is important to be consistent! Using the same name for

Placing Conda environments outside of the default `~/miniconda3/envs/` folder comes with a couple
of minor drawbacks. First, `conda` can no longer find your environment with the `--name` flag;
you’ll generally need to pass the `--prefix` flag along with the environment’s full path to
find the environment.

Second, an annoying side-effect of specifying an install path when creating your Conda
environments is that your command prompt is now prefixed with the active environment’s absolute
path rather than the environment's name. After activating an environment using its prefix your
prompt will look similar to the following.

~~~
(/absolute/path/to/env) $
~~~

As you can imagine, this can quickly get out of hand.

~~~
(/Users/USER_NAME/research/data-science/PROJECT_NAME/env) $
~~~

If (like me!) you find this long prefix to your shell prompt annoying, then there is a quick fix:
modify the `env_prompt` setting in your `.condarc` file, which you can do with the following
command.

~~~
$ conda config --set env_prompt '({name})'
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This will either edit your `~/.condarc` file if you already have one or create a `~/.condarc` file
if you do not. Now your command prompt will display the active environment’s generic name.

~~~
$ cd project-directory
$ conda activate ./env
(env) project-directory $
~~~
{: .language-bash}

For more on modifying your `.condarc` file, see the
[official Conda docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/use-condarc.html).

## Listing existing environments

Now that you have created a number of Conda environments on your local machine you have probably
forgotten the names of all of the environments and exactly where they live. Fortunately, there is
a `conda` command to list all of your existing environments together with their locations.

~~~
$ conda env list
~~~
{: .language-bash}

## Listing the contents of an environment

In addition to forgetting names and locations of Conda environments, at some point you will
probably forget exactly what has been installed in a particular Conda environment. Again, there is
a `conda` command for listing the contents on an environment. To list the contents of the
`basic-scipy-env` that you created above, run the following command.

~~~
$ conda list --name basic-scipy-env
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If you created your Conda environment using the `--prefix` option to install packages into a
particular directory, then you will need to use that prefix in order for `conda` to locate the
environment on your machine.

~~~
$ conda list --prefix /path/to/conda-env
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Listing the contents of a particular environment.

## Deleting entire environments

Occasionally, you will want to delete an entire environment. Perhaps you were experimenting with
`conda` commands and you created an environment you have no intention of using; perhaps you no
longer need an existing environment and just want to get rid of cruft on your machine. Whatever
the reason, the command to delete an environment is the following.

~~~
$ conda remove --name my-first-conda-env --all
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If you wish to delete and environment that you created with a `--prefix` option, then you will
need to provide the prefix again when removing the environment.

~~~
$ conda remove --prefix /path/to/conda-env/ --all
~~~
{: .language-bash}
