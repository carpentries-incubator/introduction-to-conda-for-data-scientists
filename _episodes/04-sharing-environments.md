## Working with environment files

When working on a collaborative research project it is often the case that your operating system 
might differ from the operating systems used by your collaborators. Similarly, the operating 
system used on a remote cluster to which you have access will likely differ from the operating 
system that you use on your local machine. In these cases it is useful to create an operating 
system agnostic environment file which you can share with collaborators or use to re-create an 
environment on a remote cluster. 

### Creating an environment file

In order to make sure that your environment is truly shareable, you need to make sure that 
that the contents of your environment are described in such a way that the resulting 
environment file can be used to re-create your environment on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. Conda 
uses YAML ("YAML Ain't Markup Language") for writing its environment files. YAML is a 
human-readable data-serialization language that is commonly used for configuration files and that 
uses Python-style indentation to indicate nesting.

Creating your project's Conda environment from a single environment file is a Conda "best practice". 
Not only do you have a file to share with collaborators but you also have a file that can be placed 
under version control which further enhancing the reproducibility of your research project and 
workflow.

> ## Default `environment.yml` file
> 
> Note that by convention Conda environment files are called `environment.yml`. As such if you use 
> the `conda env create` sub-command without passing the `--file` option, then `conda` will expect to 
> find a file called `environment.yml` in the current working directory and will throw an error if a 
> file with that name can not be found.
{: .callout}

Let's take a look at a few example `environment.yml` files  to give you an idea of how to write 
your own environment files.

~~~
name: machine-learning-env

dependencies:
  - ipython
  - matplotlib
  - pandas
  - pip
  - python
  - scikit-learn
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

This `environment.yml` file would create an environment called `machine-learning-env` with the 
most current and mutually compatible versions of the listed packages (including all required 
dependencies). The newly created environment would be installed inside the `~/miniconda3/envs/` 
directory, unless we specified a different path using `--prefix`.

Since explicit versions numbers for all packages should be preferred a better environment 
file would be the following.

~~~
name: machine-learning-env

dependencies:
  - ipython=7.13
  - matplotlib=3.1
  - pandas=1.0
  - pip=20.0
  - python=3.6
  - scikit-learn=0.22
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

Note that we are only specifying the major and minor version numbers and not the patch or build 
numbers. Defining the version number by fixing only the major and minor version numbers while 
allowing the patch version number to vary allows us to use our environment file to update our 
environment to get any bug fixes whilst still maintaining significant consistency of our 
Conda environment across updates.

> ## *Always* version control your `environment.yml` files!
>
> While you should *never* version control the contents of your `env/` environment sub-directory, 
> you should *always* version control your `environment.yml` files. Version controlling your 
> `environment.yml` files together with your project's source code means that you always know 
> which versions of which packages were used to generate your results at any particular point in 
> time.
{: .callout}

Let's suppose that you want to use the `environment.yml` file defined above to create a Conda 
environment in a sub-directory of some project directory. Here is how you would accomplish this 
task.

~~~
$ cd ~/Desktop/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists
$ mkdir phd-project-dir
$ cd phd-project-dir
~~~

Once your project folder is created, create `environment.yml` using your favourite editor for instance `nano`.
Finally create a new conda environment:

~~~
$ conda env create --prefix ./env --file environment.yml
$ conda activate ./env
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Note that the above sequence of commands assumes that the `environment.yml` file is stored within 
your `project-dir` directory. 

## Automatically generate an environment.yml
 
To export the packages installed into the previously created `machine-learning-env` you can run the 
following command:

~~~
$ conda env export --name machine-learning-env 
~~~
{: .language-bash}

When you run this command, you will see the resulting YAML formatted representation of your Conda 
environment streamed to the terminal. Recall that we only listed five packages when we 
originally created `machine-learning-env` yet from the output of the `conda env export` command 
we see that these five packages result in an environment with roughly 80 dependencies!

To export this list into an environment.yml file, you can use `--file` option to directly save the resulting YAML environment into a file:

~~~
$ conda env export --name machine-learning-env --file ~/Desktop/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/environment.yml
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Make sure you do not have any other environment.yml file from before in the same directory when running the above command.
This file will however not *consistently* produce environments that are reproducible 
across Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. The reason is, that it may include operating system specific
low-level packages, which cannot be used by other operating systems.
One way to avoid this, is to just include those packages into the environment file that have 
been specifically installed:

~~~
$ conda env export --name machine-learning-env --from-history --file ~/Desktop/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/environment.yml
~~~
{: .language-bash}

In short: to make sure others can reproduce your environment independent of the operating 
systems in use, add the `--from-history` argument.

### Updating an environment

You are unlikely to know ahead of time which packages (and version numbers!) you will need to use 
for your research project. For example it may be the case that...  

*   ...one of your core dependencies just released a new version (dependency version number update).
*   ...you need an additional package for data analysis (add a new dependency).
*   ...you have found a better visualization package and no longer need to old visualization package 
    (add new dependency and remove old dependency).

If any of these occurs during the course of your research project, all you need to do is update 
the contents of your `environment.yml` file accordingly and then run the following command.

~~~
$ conda env update --prefix ./env --file environment.yml  --prune
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Note that the `--prune` option cause Conda to remove any dependencies that are no longer required 
from the environment.

> ## Rebuilding a Conda environment from scratch
> 
> When working with `environment.yml` files it is often just as easy to rebuild the Conda 
> environment from scratch whenever you need to add or remove dependencies. To rebuild a Conda 
> environment from scratch you can pass the `--force` option to the `conda env create` command

> environment file.

> $ conda env create --prefix ./env --file environment.yml --force

## Sharing your Conda environment with Binder

The `environment.yml` you previously created can be exchanged with your colleagues who can then try it out on their local computer. A better approach is to add it to [Github](https://github.com/) and use [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): your Conda environment can then be used by any users without requiring them to install anything on their machine.

This approach involves the following steps:

- Go to [Github.com](https://github.com/) and login with your github username ([create a github account](https://github.com/join) if you do not have one yet).
- Create a new github repository: in the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select New repository.
![github repository creation](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/repo-create.png)
- To upload your Conda `environment.yml` file, navigate on Github to the main page of the repository and above the list of files, using the Add file drop-down, click Upload files.
![upload file](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/upload-files-button.png)
- Then Drag and drop the file or folder you'd like to upload to your repository onto the file tree. 
- At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. 
- Go to [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) where you’ll see a form that asks you to specify a repository for mybinder.org to build. In the first field, paste the URL of your forked repository. It’ll look something like this:

~~~
https://github.com/<your-username>/my-repo-ame
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Finally, click the launch button. This will ask mybinder.org to build the environment needed to run the repository. You can click on the “Build logs” button to see the logs generated by the build process.

While your Binder repository is building, note the URL that points to your unique Binder. You can share this URL with a friend, allowing them to access an interactive version of your repository.

See below for a quick layout of the BinderHub user interface.

## Making Jupyter aware of your Conda environments

Both JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks automatically ensure that the standard IPython kernel is 
always available by default. However, if you want to use a kernel based on a particular Conda 
environment from inside Jupyter (and Juptyer is *not* installed inside your environment) then will 
need to create a 
[kernel spec](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kernels.html#kernelspecs) file for 
your Conda environments manually.

Before you can create a custom kernel for you Conda environment you need to make sure that the 
[`ipykernel`](https://pypi.org/project/ipykernel/) package is installed in your Conda environment 
as you will need to use this package to create the kernel spec file. Here is the updated `xgboost-env`
`environment.yml` file that includes the `ipykernel` package.

~~~
name: ml-env

dependencies:
  - ipykernel=5.3
  - ipython=7.13
  - matplotlib=3.1
  - pandas=1.0
  - pip=20.0
  - python=3.6
  - scikit-learn=0.22
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

Next, rebuild the Conda environment using the following command.

~~~
$ conda env create --prefix ./env --file environment.yml --force
~~~

Once the Conda environment has been re-built you can activate the environment and then create the 
custom kernel for the activated environment.

~~~
$ conda activate ./env
$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name xgboost-env --display-name "XGBoost"
~~~

The last command installs a kernel spec file for the current environment. Kernel spec files are 
JSON files which can be viewed and changed with a normal text editor. The `--name` value is used 
by Jupyter internally; `--display-name` is what you see in the JupyterLab launcher menu as well as 
the Jupyter Notebook dropdown kernel menu. This command will overwrite any existing kernel with 
the same name.
