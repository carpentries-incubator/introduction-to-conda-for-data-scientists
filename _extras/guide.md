## Conda on HPC systems

Many HPC systems make either Miniconda or Anaconda (or both!) available to users via
[Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/). In this case a user will need to load the
relevant module instead of installing Conda.

~~~
$ module load miniconda
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Avoid running the `conda init` command
>
> Using the `conda init` command is not advisable on HPC systems that use Environment Modules
> to make Miniconda or Anaconda available to users. The reason is that running the `conda init`
> command makes changes to a user's `~/.bashrc` file. If the user subsequently forgets to reverse
> these changes using `conda init --reverse`, then `conda` will still be available even after
> unloading or purging the `miniconda` module. This opens the distinct possibility of a user
> accidently leaving his/her shell environment in an unexpected state.
