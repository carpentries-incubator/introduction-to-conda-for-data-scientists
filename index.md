This lesson is an introduction to the 
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) for (data) scientists. Conda is 
an open source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. 
Conda installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, 
loads, and switches between environments on your local computer. While Conda was created for Python 
programs it can package and distribute software for any languages such as R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, 
Java, JavaScript, C/ C++, FORTRAN. This lesson motivates the use of Conda as a development tool 
for building and sharing project specific software environments that facilitate reproducible 
(data) science workflows.
