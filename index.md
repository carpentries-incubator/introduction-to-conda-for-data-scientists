This lesson is an introduction to Conda for (data) scientists.
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) is an open source package and
environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda installs, runs, and
updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between
environments on your local computer. While Conda was created for Python programs it can package
and distribute software for any languages such as R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++,
and FORTRAN. This lesson motivates the use of Conda as a development tool for building and sharing
project-specific software environments that facilitate reproducible (data) science workflows.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This is an intermediate lesson and assumes familiarity with the core materials covered in the
> [Software Carpentry Lessons] [swc-lessons]. In particular learners need to be familiar with
> material covered in [The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice),
> [Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice), and either
> [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder) or
> [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder).
