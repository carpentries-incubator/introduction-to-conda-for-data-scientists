# Introduction to Conda for (Data) Scientists

This lesson is an introduction to Conda for (data) scientists.
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) is an open source package and
environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda installs, runs, and
updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between
environments on your local computer. While Conda was created for Python programs it can package
and distribute software for any languages such as R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++,
FORTRAN. This lesson motivates the use of Conda as a development tool for building and sharing
project specific software environments that facilitate reproducible (data) science workflows.
